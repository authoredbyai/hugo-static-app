Getting Started

Thanks for joining in on our beta!

The OpenAI API is built to flexibly solve a number of language tasks with a unified text-in, text-out interface.

Here are a few examples of how you can use the API:

1. [**TEXT GENERATION**](https://beta.openai.com/api-docs#text-generation)

   Program the API by describing your task in plain english as a set of instructions, or giving a few written examples. For example, summarization, translation, composing emails, and much more.
2. [**SEMANTIC SEARCH**](https://beta.openai.com/api-docs#semantic-search)

   Find documents, paragraphs or sentences similar to a query or natural language question. Use it on its own, or as a re-ranker for your existing search backend.
3. [**TEXT CLASSIFICATION**](https://beta.openai.com/api-docs#text-classification)

   Train the API to classify text with just a few plain-text examples, or fine-tune for any classification task on a bigger dataset. For example, sentiment, tone, or quality of English.

**Before setting your application live, your use case must be approved by our team.**

Our goal is to review how you’ve implemented the API, and work with you to make sure it’s set up properly to minimize harmful bias or other negative effects on your users. See our [**process for deployment**](https://beta.openai.com/deployment) and [**usage guidelines**](https://beta.openai.com/usage-guidelines) for additional information.

**Any outputs must be attributed to your name/company. Please use your judgement and discretion before posting API outputs on social media.**

You are interacting with the raw model, which means we do not filter out biased or negative responses. With great power comes great responsibility. (Also, let us know if you'd like to try out our content filter which we're currently piloting!)
